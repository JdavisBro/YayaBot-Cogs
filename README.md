# YayaBot-Cogs
These are cogs for YayaBot that really shouldn't be in the actual repository for yayabot

This can be installed by going into your YayaBot cogs directory and running `git clone https://github.com/JdavisBro/YayaBot-Cogs` (or you can clone it elsewhere and make a link in the cogs folder)

Running `[p]cog list` should give a list of cogs, ones from this are prefixed with `YayaBot-Cogs.` because they are in this folder!
